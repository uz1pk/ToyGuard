# ToyGuard

A toy implementation of the [wireguard](https://www.wireguard.com/) protocol with the client being used on my laptop and an EC2 instance with some additional network configuration acting as my VPN server.

## Motivation

I've been pretty ntereseted in learning the network stack and have been keeping my notes in my [tech-notes](https://github.com/uz1pk/tech-notes) repository while I've been progressing on this journey. When I got to the topic of VPNs, and how they were implented, I actually struggled quite a bit. Even after I felt like I understood them at a high level I didn't really feel that confident, as such I thought why not implement a VPN client/server myself to solidify not only my understanding of VPNs but also any other networking concepts I may have not been confident in.
